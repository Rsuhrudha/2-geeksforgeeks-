"Permute two arrays such that sum of every pair is greater or equal to K"
Statement:-Given two arrays of equal size n and an integer k. The task is to permute both arrays such that sum of their corresponding 
element is greater than or equal to k i.e a[i] + b[i] >= k. The task is to print “Yes” if any such permutation exists, otherwise print “No”.
logic :-1st array sort in ascending order,2nd sort in descending order 
        sum up l[i]+l1[i]=>k then continue 
        else break print("no")
code:-
l=list(map(int,input().split(' ')))
l1=list(map(int,input().split(' ')))
k=int(input())
l.sort()
l1.sort(reverse=True)
f=0
for i in l:
    if l[i]+l1[i]!=k:
        f=1
        break
if f==1:
    print("no")
else:
    print("yes")
